The dataset used for this analysis is a dummy ecommerce sales dataset that contains the following features:

Order ID, Customer ID, Product Details (Category, Subcategory, Product Name)
Sales Metrics (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit)
Location Data (Country, City, State, Region)
Temporal Data (Year, Order Date, Ship Date)
The data was cleaned and transformed into an Excel Table format, allowing for efficient use of Pivot Tables and charts for analysis.

## Methodology/Approach
Data Preparation: The raw data was converted into a Table format in Excel for easier manipulation and analysis.
KPIs Calculation: Key performance indicators such as total sales, profit, and profit margin were calculated for the years 2011-2014.
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: YoY growth for sales and profit was calculated to identify trends and compare year-over-year performance.
Data Visualization: Various charts and graphs were created to visualize sales vs. profit trends, category-wise profit, sales distribution by state, and top-performing subcategories.
Interactive Dashboard: Filters and slicers for years, regions, and segments were added to make the dashboard interactive and enable dynamic analysis.
